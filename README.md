# Zig Lox bytecode implementation

Following the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom,
I'm implementing the Lox language in Zig, from chapters 14 onwards.

Implementation of previous chapters in Kotlin can be found in the [klox](https://github.com/Vojtasii/klox) repository.
